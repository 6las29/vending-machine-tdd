#Key things that I have learned:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The importance of writing tests before implementing
   functionality to ensure code correctness and reliability. That also help us avoid errors on large scale
   of code no-tested.

2. **Modular Code**: Structuring code in a modular way allows for better reusability and maintainability.

3. **Use of Testing Frameworks**: Familiarity with testing frameworks like QUnit
   and Tape for writing and running tests. And I have learn that it is important to start with some test
   that won't work on purpose and adapt the code to match it. After that, we take a specific case thta 
   works for now. We update our function to pass the test also. We have to ensure that for each new test we add,
   the function must pass through all of them successfully in order to be validate.

4. **Isomorphic JavaScript**: Understanding how to write code that can run in both Node.js and browser environments. 
    It is nothing special, just some js code code well formatted and that shows us 
    how polyvalent Javascript is for running either on browser environment or on server using Node.js

5. **Change Calculation Logic**: Implementing algorithms to calculate change efficiently,
   considering various denominations

6. **Error Handling**: Recognizing the importance of handling edge cases and errors in code to prevent unexpected behavior.

7. **Code Coverage**: Using tools like Istanbul to measure code coverage and ensure that tests cover all parts of the code.

8. **Continuous Integration**: The practice of integrating code changes frequently and running tests to catch issues early.

9. **Version Control**: Using version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate on code.

10. **Documentation**: Writing clear documentation with JsDoc and comments to explain code functionality and test cases.
